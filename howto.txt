First, connect the grounds (GND) between the boards:

On both Nexys DDR boards, locate the Pmod connectors (they're the small headers with pins)
On each Pmod connector, pin 5 or 6 is typically GND
Connect these GND pins between boards with a jumper wire


For the data connection:

The code uses pin C17, which is on Pmod JA, pin 1
Connect a single jumper wire from Pmod JA pin 1 on the transmitter board to Pmod JA pin 1 on the receiver board
